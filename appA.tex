\chapter{Nomenclature}\label{app:nomenclature}

What goes in the appendices? Any material which impedes the smooth development of your presentation, but which is important to justify the results of a thesis. Generally, it is material that is of a too-nitty-gritty level of detail for inclusion in the main body of the thesis but which should be available for perusal by the examiners to convince them sufficiently. Examples include program listings, immense tables of data, lengthy mathematical proofs or derivations, etc. 

Example:
\begin{enumerate}
        \item Nomenclature or any compact and consistent formalisation
	\item Additional mathematical proofs or data descriptions
	\item Complete results that would be too verbose for the Evaluation section but would give additional proof to the readers that your arguments are valid (e.g. more complete detail on your simulation runs).
\end{enumerate}
